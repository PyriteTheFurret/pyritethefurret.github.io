        Each character data block has many data values in it:
            "pos": An array of two (or three) numbers showing where the character is in the list
            "name": The character's real name and/or any aliases and nicknames the character goes by or is referred to as.
            "desc": A description of the character, maybe some info or whatever goes here.
                You could feasibly put anything related to said character here.
            "img": An array containing links to images of the character, both directly from the site and from elsewhere.
                I might make different variables for PFP art and other art of the character, but I don't know if I should.
            "gender": Gender.
            "species": Species.
            "origin": The character's AU of origin. Only really used for characters with multiple AU counterparts.
